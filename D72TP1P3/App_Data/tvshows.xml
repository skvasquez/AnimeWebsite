		<tvshowPlot>Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by the Titans. Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by building a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the largest of Titans. Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a Titan in over a hundred years, until one day, a Colossal Titan appears out of thin air and destroys part of the city wall. As teenage boy Eren Jaeger and his foster sister Mikasa Ackerman witness the destruction of their town and death of their mother at the hands of the Titans, Eren vows to kill every single Titan and take revenge for all of mankind.</tvshowPlot>

		<tvshowPlot>It has been 10 years since Heaven&apos;s Gate appeared in South America and Hell&apos;s Gate appeared in Japan, veiling the once familiar night sky with an oppressive skyscape. Their purposes unknown, these Gates are spaces in which the very laws of physics are ignored. With the appearance of the Gates emerged Contractors, who, in exchange for their humanity, are granted supernatural abilities.			In the Japanese city surrounding Hell’s Gate, Section 4 Chief Misaki Kirihara finds herself at odds with an infamous Contractor codenamed Hei. Called &quot;Black Reaper&quot; in the underground world, Hei, like his associates, undertakes missions for the mysterious and ruthless Syndicate while slowly peeling back the dark layers covering a nefarious plot that threatens the very existence of Contractors.			From the mind of Tensai Okamura comes a sci-fi thriller taking the form of a subtle exposé on a war in which political positions and justice have no sway—a war waged exclusively in the shadows.</tvshowPlot>

						<episodeTitle>Best Partners</episodeTitle>
						<episodeNumber>1</episodeNumber>
						<episodePlot>The members of Fairy Tail prepare for the guild&apos;s annually S-Class Promotion Exam, which will grant the S-Class rank to the one who passes. The eight participants - Natsu, Gray, Juvia, Elfman, Cana, Freed, Levy, and Mest (a man who claims to be Mystogan&apos;s disciple) - are instructed to choose a partner to accompany them during the exam, which is to take place on Tenrou Island, Fairy Tail&apos;s holy ground. Natsu partners with Happy, Gray with Loke (who temporarily nullifies his contract with Lucy to do so), Juvia with Lisanna, Elfman with Evergreen, Freed with Bickslow, Levy with Gajeel, and Mest with Wendy. During this time, Cana tells Lucy that she intends to leave the guild should she fail the exam, stating that she has failed the exam four times before. She reveals her reasons for doing so to Lucy, who offers to become Cana&apos;s partner. Meanwhile, Charle has brief glimpses of disastrous events in the future, one of which includes the black-haired youth from the forest.</episodePlot>

Later Gajeel is called out by 2 fairy tail members to the tree where he had attacked them back during the Phantom Lord ordeal to fight.

						<episodePlot>Back in Shirō&apos;s home, Rin explains that he had been chosen as a Master for the Holy Grail War, then explains the basics behind it. When Shirō is unable to comprehend the situation, Rin decides to take him to see Kirei Kotomine, a priest who is her legal guardian and also the overseer of the Holy Grail War. When they arrive at Kirei&apos;s church and meet up with him, Shirō learns that once someone is chosen to fight as a Master, their responsibilities are unavoidable. He then learns about the Holy Grail and the purpose of the Holy Grail War. Then, Shirō learns that there were four Holy Grail Wars before the current one, with the latest one taking place ten years ago. When he asks what happens if a Master with dark intentions wins the Grail, Kirei replies that there can be no action taken against the victor, and that the only way he could prevent such a Master from winning is to win it himself. He then adds that at the conclusion of the previous Holy Grail War, a Master with dark intentions touched the Grail, resulting in the fire that Shirō survived, a revelation which horrifies Shirō. Kirei then reveals that before the unworthy Master appeared, another Master actually won the Grail and held it, but because the Grail hadn&apos;t fully materialized at the time due to this Master refusing to fight, it deemed him unworthy to hold it. As a result of all the information he had just learned, Shirō finally accepts his responsibilities as a Master. Regrouping with Saber outside of the church, Shirō declares that he will be her Master, and they agree to fight in the Holy Grail War together. Later, Archer informs Rin that since Shirō is now a proper Master, they should attack, but she responds that she still has a debt to pay him and instead decides to let him and Saber return home. Moments later, they are confronted by the same silver-haired girl Shirō briefly met earlier, who is revealed to also be a Master, and her Servant, which Rin identifies as belonging to the Berserker class.</episodePlot>

When the fight moves away into the suburbs, Rin orders Shirō to run, but he remembers his agreement with Saber and instead follows them. As the fight progresses, Kirei is visited by a mysterious blond, red-eyed man, and they both claim their intentions to witnessing the Holy Grail&apos;s materialization in its fullest detail. The fight then moves through a forest and into a local cemetery, while Rin tries to kill Illyasviel, but she counters with several bird-shaped homunculi. Rin is rescued by Archer&apos;s attacks. While running back to Saber, Rin runs into Shirō, and they watch as Saber kills Berserker, which then suddenly resurrects and regenerates itself, one of its Noble Phantasms. Archer projects and fires a sword-shaped arrow at Berserker, which engulfs it in a massive explosion, but it fails to affect it. Illyasviel, impressed by Archer&apos;s strength, withdraws Berserker and flees. Seconds later, Shirō suddenly begins vomiting blood.</episodePlot>

						<episodePlot>Shirō wakes up in his home, uninjured and Rin sitting at his side. She leaves, but not before telling him that when they meet next time, it will be as enemies. Shirō then finds Saber in the dojo, and she reveals that he has self-healing magical capabilities, explaining the absence of the injuries he sustained in the battle with Berserker. Saber then explains the mechanics of the seven Servants and the advantages and disadvantages of knowing a Servant&apos;s real-life identity, then asks that she not reveal her identity to him since he is an inexperienced mage, a request he approves of. Shirō and Saber then go to school to deliver lunch to the archery club. There, Saber explores the school and has a tense encounter with Sōichirō Kuzuki, one of the instructors, before they are interrupted by Shirō. Later that day, while still at the school, Shirō is approached by Mitsuzuri, who asks if he will rejoin the archery club before noting he has never smiled in his life. While walking home with Saber, Sakura, and Taiga, he explains that Saber is a friend of Kiritsugu&apos;s and will be staying with him temporarily. Sakura is seemingly horrified by the idea, but Taiga approves under the condition that she stay in the home as well during that time. Elsewhere, Rin and Archer investigate an office building purportedly having a gas leak and find it is actually the work of another Servant who is absorbing the life force of the employees inside. They theorize that the Servant responsible is of the Caster class and is likely at Ryuudou Temple. When Rin decides to pursue Caster, Archer notes that she is ignoring Shirō, who she could easily kill to get him out of her way, and asks what will happen if Shirō approaches her again.</episodePlot>

						<episodePlot>Five years ago, Kiritsugu tells Shirō about how he once wished to become a hero of justice. Shirō promises him that he will fulfill that dream for him, after which Kiritsugu passes away in satisfaction. In the present day, Shirō goes to school alone, despite Saber&apos;s insistence that she accompany him. At school, he learns from Issei that Mitsuzuri had gone missing the previous day and that she was last seen arguing with Shinji, who is currently absent, with no one able to contact him. As school ends for the day, Shirō is confronted by Rin, who attacks him despite his protests. After a brief chase, Rin eventually corners him and tries threatening him into handing over his remaining Command Seals, but before she could carry out her threat, they hear a scream. Shirō investigates and finds an unconscious student who had most of her mana absorbed. As Rin treats the student, Shirō is wounded after shielding her from an incoming attack by an unknown female Servant. He then pursues the Servant into the nearby woods, where he is restrained and nearly killed by her, only to be saved by Rin, whose appearance prompts the Servant to flee. Rin treats Shirō&apos;s wounds and decides to call off their fight, taking him to her house to evaluate the situation. Then, the two agree to have a truce and track down the Servant and her Master together. The following night, Rin learns of Shirō&apos;s magical training, which she is outraged by, as Kiritsugu didn&apos;t adhere to the tradition of magecraft by prioritizing himself as a father rather than a mage.</episodePlot>

He then explains that Servants are no more than mere tools for their Masters and reveals that he died with no unfulfilled dreams before disappearing. Returning home, Shirō learns from Taiga that Mitsuzuri was found alive without any visible injuries. He then meets up with Saber and tells her of the truce he made with Rin, which she approves of. The next day, at the school library, Shirō and Rin discuss on how to locate the female Servant&apos;s Master before Shirō senses a sigil in one of the bookshelves, which Rin disables. They then explore the school grounds and disable other sigils, which they realize were set up for strengthening the magical barrier placed over the school. While preparing to head home, Shirō is confronted by Shinji, who reveals himself as the female Servant&apos;s Master and also the one who set up the barrier, also exposing the entire Matō family as a former clan of mages. Shinji then tries to convince Shirō to form an alliance, but he turns the offer down, although he promises to keep quiet about their conversation. The following night, Shirō wakes up and finds himself restrained at Ryuudou Temple. He is approached by a hooded female Servant, identified as Caster, who admits responsibility for a purported series of gas leaks all over Fuyuki, enraging Shirō. Caster then expresses her intention to remove Shirō&apos;s Command Seals and transplant them to her own Master, but before she could do so, Archer intervenes and prepares to engage Caster in battle. Meanwhile, Saber senses Shirō&apos;s disappearance and heads to Ryuudou Temple, only to be faced by a second Servant, who identifies himself as an Assassin-class Servant and claims to be the Japanese swordsman Sasaki Kojirō. Then, he challenges Saber to a duel.</episodePlot>

						<episodePlot>Saber engages Assassin in battle after he threatens the safety of Shirō, and is shocked to find that despite her advantages in strength and agility, she cannot break through his defenses. At Ryuudou Temple, Caster reveals that Assassin is her own Servant, as she is a mage as well. Archer claims that she broke the rules of the Holy Grail War and insults her tactics before engaging her in battle. After a while, Archer manages to critically wound Caster, prompting Assassin to finish his assault prematurely with his Noble Phantasm. When Caster asks Archer why he is not finishing her off, he responds that his main goal was Shirō&apos;s safety and he is not a believer in senseless slaughter. This causes Caster to compare Shirō and Archer, claiming that their ideals are so identical that they are &quot;the same&quot;, before trying to ask them to join her, although both reject the offer. Archer then allows Caster to flee despite the fact that she will continue to kill innocent people. When Shirō protests this decision, Archer counters that doing so will be instrumental in the defeats of not only her, but those of her Master and Berserker. Disgusted by Archer&apos;s willingness to allow collateral damage, Shirō criticizes his ideals, and Archer defends them, citing that if Caster were to win the Holy Grail, the damage would extend far beyond Fuyuki. Unable to accept this, Shirō tries going after Caster alone, but is slashed in the back by Archer. He staggers out of Ryuudou Temple and is tended to by Saber, who survived Assassin&apos;s Noble Phantasm. Archer continues his assault, but is distracted by Assassin, who is impressed by Saber&apos;s power and allows her and Shirō to escape. At the dojo, after commenting on Archer&apos;s swordsmanship, Shirō, now unwilling to lose to him again, asks Saber to teach him how to fight with a sword.</episodePlot>

He notes to Saber that he is using Archer&apos;s techniques as a basis for his study, which seems to upset Saber. Arriving at school late, Shirō is met by Shinji, who greets him ominously. During lunchtime, Rin reluctantly forces Shirō to eat with her at the school rooftop. She reveals that she learned about Archer&apos;s attack on him and was forced to use a Command Seal to prevent him from further attacking him. Shirō asks about the Matō family being a bloodline of mages; Rin responds that while they are, their magical abilities died off with each generation. She then admits that she had recently found out Shinji was a Master, but relented in attacking him because he lacked experience in magic, and that as a result, there is another Master present in the school. Then, Shinji&apos;s Servant activates a second, much stronger magical barrier around the school, which absorbs the mana of everyone but Shirō and Rin. The two are attacked by skeletal beings called Golems, and Shirō summons Saber via Command Seal. Saber battles the Golems while he and Rin go to the school&apos;s first floor to disable the barrier. After dispatching several Golems, Saber faces off against Shinji&apos;s Servant, who is identified as being of the Rider class, and manages to stab her, but Rider is revealed to be an apparition created by Caster, who disappears. Meanwhile, Shirō and Rin find Shinji and the corpse of the real Rider, which dissolves, causing the barrier to dissipate. Shinji refuses to identify the Servant who killed Rider and flees the school. After Shirō, Rin, and Saber assess the situation and deduce that Caster killed Rider, Rin notes Shirō&apos;s ability to recognize the conditions of the unconscious students and employees, and he replies that he was used to seeing dead bodies, which confuses Rin.</episodePlot>

Meanwhile, Shinji arrives at Kirei&apos;s church and pleads with him to offer him shelter and protection. However, when he finds out he was the first Master to lose his Servant, he blames the loss on Rider, yelling that she was useless as a Servant. Realizing Shinji still has a resolve to fight, Kirei tells him there is one additional Servant available for usage. After clearing Issei of being Caster&apos;s Master, Shirō encounters Rin, who is spying on the blond-haired, red-eyed man who visited Kirei at his church; the man had been observing the Matō home for some time. When the man leaves, Rin asks Shirō about what would happen if someone were to be adopted by another family against his or her will, and forced to grow up in their care. While eating dinner, Taiga tells Saber about Shirō&apos;s childhood and Kiritsugu, commenting that they seemed to be polar opposites of each other due to their personalities, and also mentions Shirō&apos;s wish to become a hero of justice. When Saber asks him why he wanted to become a hero of justice, Shirō vaguely replies that it was because he looked up to them. However, while in his room alone, he concludes he only wanted to follow in Kiritsugu&apos;s footsteps, and then remembers Archer&apos;s words that his ideals were flawed.</episodePlot>

She later discusses Shirō&apos;s reliability as an ally with Archer, who suggests Caster would be a more efficient partner for them, which upsets her. At school, Shirō notices Issei talking with Kuzuki and learns from him that Kuzuki lives at Ryuudou Temple with a mysterious woman who is believed to be his fiancée. Rin theorizes from the information that Kuzuki is Caster&apos;s Master and plans on confirming them by attacking Kuzuki with a non-lethal magical attack and observe his reaction. The following night, Shirō, Rin, and Saber set up their quarters at an abandoned gas station where Kuzuki usually passes by. When he arrives, Rin fires the magical attack on him, but he is unaffected and Caster arrives for assistance. An outraged Shirō confronts Kuzuki and asks if he knew about Caster&apos;s attacks on innocent people; Kuzuki responds that he was unaware but did not care the slightest, revealing himself to be a former killer. Rin then attacks Caster as a distraction while Saber tries to strike Kuzuki, but Kuzuki uses magically-strengthened fists to subdue Saber and Rin, then brutalizes Shirō. In response, he summons Archer&apos;s dual swords and uses them to repel Kuzuki&apos;s attacks. When Saber and Rin regain consciousness, Kuzuki and Caster flee. Rin asks Shirō how he was able to summon weapons, and he reveals that while he specialized in strengthening magic, he first succeeded at using projection magic. Meanwhile, Shinji meets his new Servant, the blond-haired, red-eyed man, who dismisses his strategy to kill innocent people for their mana and reveals his plan to use the Holy Grail to kill most of the human population in the world.</episodePlot>

Shirō claims he is fine so as not to worry Saber, but is clearly in pain and off-balance as a result of using projection magic. The next day, he goes to school and finds that Kuzuki is absent due to what is claimed to be an illness. After school, Shirō returns home, where Rin suddenly arrives unannounced. The two proceed to formulate a strategy to deal with Caster. However, their only viable plan is a full-frontal attack against Ryuudou Temple. While Rin and Saber agree it is their best shot, they fear that Caster might opt to destroy the entire temple if she is cornered. After dinner, Shirō meets Rin in the courtyard, where she muses that Shirō&apos;s house is more open and welcoming than her own, and that perhaps it is better that Shirō did not adopt the lifestyle of a true mage. She then tells Shirō that she became a mage because she personally enjoys studying magic, and asks him what his reasons for studying magic are. Shirō responds that he wants to use magic to help others, which frustrates Rin, who cites that it is not right for him to put the happiness of others above his own. She then tells Shirō that she will be staying at his house for the night. Later that night, Shirō returns to the shed to practice his magic. Saber comes in to check on him, and he tells her how Kiritsugu was a good man and how he wanted to be a hero like him. Archer then arrives and asks Shirō about his symptoms, knowing precisely the side-effects of using projection magic. He tells Shirō that the pain he is feeling is due to activating magic circuits that had long lay dormant. After repairing Shirō&apos;s magic circuits and noting that he once went through a similar experience, Archer warns him that his ideals are meaningless and doomed to fail, something Shirō denies.</episodePlot>

Caster reveals she has taken Taiga hostage and threatens to kill her unless Shirō hands over his magical circuits to her. When Shirō refuses, Caster tells him that she knows about the fire that he survived ten years ago, then claims her knowledge of a method to summon the Holy Grail without any further fighting, which can only be accomplished by Saber&apos;s mana. Shirō allows Caster to take his Command Seals in order to rescue Taiga, but an ambivalent Saber engages Caster in battle. Shirō uses a Command Seal to stop Saber, allowing Caster to stab her in the heart with a dagger-like Noble Phantasm called &quot;Rule Breaker&quot;, which takes Shirō&apos;s remaining Command Seals and gives Caster control over Saber. After releasing Taiga, Caster forces Saber to kill Rin, but Shirō is injured while taking the blow. Saber then resists against Caster&apos;s magic long enough for Shirō, Rin, and Taiga to escape with assistance from Archer. Regaining consciousness at Rin&apos;s house, Shirō finds a jewel. He recognizes it as the same one that had been used on him while Rin revived him after he was stabbed by Lancer during the first battle. Meanwhile, Caster arrives at Kirei&apos;s church and demands the location of the Lesser Grail, the vessel for the Holy Grail. When he refuses to disclose it, she has him attacked by Golems. Shirō finds Rin at the top of a skyscraper and tries offering his assistance. However, she tells him that without Saber as his Servant, there is no longer a reason for him to be involved in the Holy Grail War and leaves with Archer. As she leaves, Rin warns him to stay out of the war, otherwise he will die.</episodePlot>

Meanwhile, at Kirei&apos;s church, Caster visits a captive Saber, who is resisting her magical torture. She is then confronted by Kuzuki, who learns that her last two attacks had been done on her own free will and that she intends to use the church to obtain the Holy Grail&apos;s vessel. After waking up from a dream about Archer, Rin goes to Kirei&apos;s church with Archer and finds bloodstains. She concludes Caster attacked Kirei, but that he somehow managed to survive. The two then confront Caster and Kuzuki, but when Rin tries to battle them, Archer suddenly defends them from her attacks. Citing that Saber had been turned over to Caster&apos;s side, Archer pledges his allegiance to Caster, revealing that she is the ancient Greek princess Medea and allowing her to stab him with Rule Breaker, which takes Rin&apos;s Command Seals. Kuzuki then tries to kill Rin, but she is saved by a recovered Shirō. Caster tries to counter with Golems, but Archer stops her and has her release Shirō and Rin as a condition for him joining forces with her. While on their way back to Shirō&apos;s home, Rin confesses that Archer joined Caster because he knew Rin&apos;s strategies were hopelessly flawed, though Shirō counters this by telling her that even though she failed this time, it doesn&apos;t mean she was wrong. After comforting her, Shirō returns to her the jewel he found at her house, telling her that he had another one at his home. When Rin asks why he rescued her, Shirō confesses that he had feelings for her, which initially embarrasses her. However, she then thanks him for saving her life.</episodePlot>

She replies that she has no choice but to let him before reaffirming their partnership. While discussing a strategy to defeat Caster and rescue Saber, the two decide to team up with Illyasviel, since Archer had told Rin that Berserker is in fact the ancient Greek hero Heracles, which might give them an advantage against Caster. Meanwhile, Caster recounts the time she was summoned by another magus for the Holy Grail War, only to be unsatisfied by his inefficient method of acquiring mana for her. After Caster requested to create mana herself, the magus realized he could not trust a magic user better than himself. As a result, he contacted Kirei and asked for another Servant, but Kirei told him to dispatch Caster first before making another Master-Servant pact. The magus then sent out a contract to Lancer&apos;s Master, a colleague, for Caster&apos;s death. In the meantime, she destroyed the magus&apos;s workshop, and then killed him when he returned and tried to use his Command Seals to force her into committing suicide. She was then gravely injured by Lancer and barely escaped with her life, but she was saved by Kuzuki, who became her new Master. In the present day, Illyasviel observes Shirō and Rin traveling to her villa, then sends out her maids to retrieve them. However, the villa is breached by Shinji and his new Servant, who reveals his knowledge that the Holy Grail&apos;s vessel is being held inside Illyasviel. When the maids retaliate in an effort to protect Illyasviel, the Servant kills them with a Noble Phantasm that summons numerous swords and fires them.

At first, she refused to believe it, but realized the truth when her father did not return home. As time passed, she stumbled upon a room in her home, containing numerous homunculi that were created to serve Illyasviel&apos;s purpose, only to fail in their missions. Realizing she too is a homunculus from their dying messages, Illyasviel became disillusioned with her life. Later on, she met her current maids, who assisted her in summoning Berserker. However, she initially did not want it, resolving to participate and win the Holy Grail War by herself. During the final test of her Master-Servant link ritual, she became lost in the nearby woods, being separated from Berserker, and was mauled by a pack of wolves. Berserker rescued her, and afterwards, she realized it was protecting her out of its own free will. In the present day, Illyasviel and Berserker continue their battle against Shinji&apos;s Servant as Shirō and Rin arrive to witness the event. As the battle reaches the main entrance, the Servant eventually restrains Berserker using chains fired from his Noble Phantasm, allowing him to impale Berserker with a large spear. Then, he blinds and then stabs Illyasviel with a sword; as she crawls to Berserker&apos;s side, it makes one last attempt to strike the Servant, only to be killed. Shirō attempts to intervene, but Illyasviel dies in comfort, believing Berserker is still at her side.</episodePlot>

While burying Illyasviel, Rin confronts Shirō about his ideals and tells him that he needs to prioritize himself over others, otherwise he will break. He denies this and tells her about the time Kiritsugu rescued him, which caused him to admire him. However, Rin tells him that it is still wrong to value the lives of others over his own, citing that someone who was spared from a terrible tragedy has to live out their life to the fullest and that wishing for the happiness of others is no different from a machine. Despite her argument, Shirō remains committed to his ideals. Later on, as they evaluate Gilgamesh&apos;s power and conclude that Caster is still their priority, the two are approached by Lancer, who offers his assistance, which they accept.

						<episodePlot>Shirō, Saber, and Lancer arrive at Illysaviel&apos;s villa, where they are met by Archer, who exposits on the true nature of his summoning: Rin had not in fact summoned him by chance, and the catalyst for his summoning was actually the pendent he carries, identical to the one Rin used to save Shirō. While Lancer runs off to retrieve Rin, Saber demands to know why Archer is so intent on killing Shirō. Archer responds that, like Shirō, he aspired to become a hero of justice and actually fulfilled that ideal, but became disillusioned by it and became a Servant so he could rectify it. He then forces Saber to reveal her back-story to Shirō: her true identity is that of King Arthur, who hoped to use the Holy Grail to undo her decision to become the king of Britain, as she believes it was her rule that eventually resulted in the country&apos;s destruction. When she then remarks that she and Archer are different in terms of how much they were able to live up to their ideals, Archer elaborates that when he became a Guardian in order to become a true hero of justice, he became disillusioned after he was forced to take lives in order to save many more. He eventually concluded that his ideals were shallow and that it was impossible to save everyone, just as he envisioned. Archer then reveals his true identity: Shirō&apos;s future self, the Heroic Spirit Emiya. Meanwhile, Shinji tries to rape Rin, only for Lancer to arrive and incapacitate him. Then, Kirei suddenly appears, exposes himself as Lancer&apos;s Master, and reveals he was the one who killed Rin&apos;s father in the previous Holy Grail War. He then orders Lancer to kill Rin, intending to use her body as a vessel for the Holy Grail. When Lancer refuses, Kirei uses one of his many Command Seals and orders him to commit suicide, which he does.

However, Shirō refuses, proclaiming that since he learned Emiya&apos;s story, he will do all he can to avoid becoming him.

After freeing Rin, he collapses to the ground and laments how he would have liked for Rin to be his Master. Both Rin and Lancer bid farewell to each other, and as Rin leaves, Lancer sets a fire to destroy both him and Kirei&apos;s corpse. Back at the main entrance, Shirō and Emiya continue to battle, with Emiya activating Unlimited Blade Works and slowly gaining the upper hand. As their swords clash, Shirō begins to see Emiya&apos;s memories and becomes aware of what his future holds in store for him. With his belief shaken, Shirō is quickly defeated by Emiya and left on the verge of death. As he lies on the ground, Shirō begins to reflect on the memories he gained from Emiya, as well as the memories of Kiritsugu saving him ten years ago. From this, Shirō concludes his ideals are not wrong, and he decides to continue to fight. At that moment, Saber&apos;s scabbard Avalon, which Kiritsugu had placed inside Shirō to restore the injuries he sustained from the fire, activates and heals Shirō&apos;s wounds. With his confidence in his ideals restored, Shirō prepares to battle Emiya again, with the declaration that he will defeat him.</episodePlot>

						<episodePlot>Shirō and Emiya continue their battle, with Emiya chastising Shirō for continuing to pursue his ideal and declaring that he will remove every trace of him in existence. However, as the battle continues, Emiya begins to realize that Shirō, being himself, will never give up and that it is pointless to defeat him now. Finally, as he explains the beauty he saw in his ideal, Shirō&apos;s spirit begins to overwhelm Unlimited Blade Works, and he rushes Emiya. Emiya tries to react, but he becomes distracted by a flashback of Kiritsugu&apos;s last moments and is wounded by Shirō, just as Rin arrives. With this, Emiya admits defeat and allows Shirō, Rin, and Saber to escape, before being impaled by three swords fired from Gilgamesh&apos;s Noble Phantasm. Declaring his hatred for fakes, Gilgamesh fires more swords at Shirō and Emiya, but Emiya pushes Shirō out of the way and dies after taking the full blow of the attack. Saber, expressing a familiarity with Gilgamesh, demands to know why he is here, and he explains that after the end of the Fourth Holy Grail War, in which he was an Archer-class Servant, he bathed in the Holy Grail during its destruction at the hands of Saber, also a Servant in that war, and took physical form. He then explains the Holy Grail&apos;s true function as a container for thousands of curses, before announcing his intention to take it for himself and use it as a weapon to eradicate the human race, being disgusted by the lifestyle of modern humans and hoping to rule over any potential survivors. He then leaves the villa and later finds Shinji in the forest, learning from him about Kirei&apos;s death and the reason behind Rin&apos;s escape. When Shinji asks about finding a vessel for the Holy Grail, Gilgamesh implants Illyasviel&apos;s heart into him, deeming him a worthy enough vessel, and leaves him as he begins to mutate into a massive, shapeless form of flesh.</episodePlot>

						<episodePlot>Returning to Shirō&apos;s home, he, Rin, and Saber all decide to avenge Emiya and stop Gilgamesh by destroying the Holy Grail once and for all. Through the use of familiar spirits, Rin deduces that the Holy Grail is being summoned at Ryuudou Temple. She then explains that Shinji, the only other magus participating in the Holy Grail War, would be the only viable candidate as a substitute vessel, as it was apparent Illysaviel was supposed to turn into the Lesser Grail at the end of the war. While devising a strategy to defeat Gilgamesh, Rin realizes Emiya was the only one who could perfectly counter him, since he had the ability to summon a duplicate of any kind of weapon. She then concludes that Shirō needs to master Unlimited Blade Works so he too could be an even match against Gilgamesh. Since he doesn&apos;t have the sufficient mana to do so, Rin improvises, performing a ritual that implants her Magic Crest into Shirō, thus allowing them to share their mana storage. During the ritual, Shirō inadvertently taps into Rin&apos;s memories, something that embarrasses Rin when she finds out. Afterwards, Shirō finds Saber exploring his house, and she thanks him for showing her the way to her dream. Then, she has him promise that he and Rin will survive the Holy Grail War. Meanwhile, Gilgamesh has finished transporting Shinji to Ryuudou Temple, which summons the Holy Grail.</episodePlot>

Saber reveals she can only use her Noble Phantasm, Excalibur, once before fading, since Rin cannot supply her with enough mana due to her sharing it with Shirō. At Ryuudou Temple, Shirō and Rin observe Shinji&apos;s mutated form and a torrent of black ooze pouring out from the Holy Grail, pooling around Shinji and forming a lake. They are then confronted by Gilgamesh, who elaborates on his intentions and explains that there are too many people in the modern era than there are significance and purpose. At the main gate, Saber instead comes across Assassin, who is still guarding the temple despite Caster&apos;s death, as it is his anchor to the world. He reveals that he is not actually the fictitious Sasaki Kojirō, but a nameless swordsman similar to him, then expresses a desire to finish his duel with Saber before he fades. As Shirō duels Gilgamesh, the Holy Grail is bombarded by what Gilgamesh claims to be mankind&apos;s malevolent wishes. Rin approaches the mass of flesh and manages to remove Shinji from it, causing it to try and use Gilgamesh as a replacement vessel. However, he defends himself with a powerful sword called Ea. Meanwhile, as they duel, Assassin reveals to Saber he is already starting to fade and tries to use his Noble Phantasm, but Saber fatally wounds him.</episodePlot>

As Gilgamesh attempts to finish Shirō off, Saber arrives and shields him, but is ordered by Shirō to save Rin. Having an epiphany about the true nature of his powers, Shirō activates Unlimited Blade Works and uses its infinite number of replicate swords to counter Gilgamesh&apos;s Noble Phantasm. Meanwhile, Saber approaches the Holy Grail and recognizes it as a corrupted, improperly-summoned Servant called Angra Mainyu. She locates Rin, who uses two Command Seals and orders her to destroy the Grail with Excalibur as she is being consumed by Angra Mainyu. When Rin loses hope at surviving, Emiya&apos;s voice chides her for giving up and a barrage of swords pelts Angra Mainyu, freeing her. With Rin free and using her final Command Seal to augment her attack, Saber unleashes Excalibur and destroys Angra Mainyu&apos;s manifestation and the Holy Grail. As she fades, Saber laments that she will be unable to watch over Rin and Shirō, but accepts that her role is over. Inside Unlimited Blade Works, Shirō manages to overwhelm Gilgamesh, who angrily tries to draw Ea, but Shirō cuts off his arm and slashes him across the chest before running out of mana. Gilgamesh tries to finish him off, but a portal to the Holy Grail opens and engulfs him. He ensnares Shirō with a chain in order to pull himself out, but Emiya, having survived Gilgamesh&apos;s attack, intervenes by shooting a dagger into Gilgamesh&apos;s head, fatally wounding him. As he speaks his last words, Gilgamesh is consumed by Angra Mainyu before the portal closes. Rin and Emiya say goodbye as he fades away, with Emiya asking her to look after his past self.

							Two years after the events of the Fifth Holy Grail War, Shirō and Rin are living together in an apartment in London while they both study under the Mages Association at the Clock Tower, with Shirō being Rin&apos;s apprentice as protection for her. However, he is still struggling with following his ideals without following the same path as Emiya. One day, Rin has a duel with fellow classmate and neighbor Luvia Edelfelt, who repeatedly flirts with Shirō, and loses, much to her chagrin. Afterwards, she and Shirō talk about his invitation to officially join the Mages Association, which conflicts with his ideals. One morning, Rin decides to take Shirō to Glastonbury, the final resting place of King Arthur, so he could say goodbye to Saber. During the trip back home, Shirō reminisces about his graduation from his second year of high school. The next day, Shirō encounters Waver Velvet, a survivor of the Fourth Holy Grail War, who questions him about his reasons for coming to the Clock Tower and studying magic after surviving the Holy Grail War. Shirō says he knows it to be stupid, but he wants to dedicate his life to fulfilling his ideal. Waver responds that while his desire is indeed idiotic, it is not something to be laughed at. Later, Shirō returns to the apartment and informs Rin he has turned down the invitation, saying he cannot change who he is, even if he is destined to meet the same fate as Emiya. Rin responds that the difference between him and Emiya will be how far he goes in following his ideals. She then assures him that she will always be by his side.							In the epilogue, Emiya is shown sitting in Unlimited Blade Works, reconsidering his life and purpose. While he admits his regrets and a belief that Shirō will end up cursing the path he himself took, he asserts in the end that he was not wrong in his ideals.

						<episodePlot>Eight years ago in Germany, Kiritsugu Emiya and his wife, Irisviel von Einzbern, welcome the birth of their daughter, Illyasviel. Though Kiritsugu fears he will lead Irisviel to her death with the upcoming Fourth Holy Grail War, Iris assures him that he is a good man who will end his torment and fulfill their ideals. Three years ago, the priest Kirei Kotomine learns that he has been chosen as a participant for the Holy Grail War; his father Risei, the war&apos;s moderator on behalf of the Catholic Church, and Tokiomi Tosaka arrange for Kirei to become Tokiomi&apos;s pupil in magecraft in order to give Tokiomi an advantage and help Kirei get over the death of his wife. One year ago in Fuyuki City, Kariya Matō visits his childhood friend Aoi Tōsaka and her daughters, Rin and Sakura, but he is shocked to learn Sakura has been adopted by the Matō family as the Matōs want a heir that uses magic and is horrified to discover on what has been done to her. Confronting his father, Zōken, Kariya strikes a deal to become a mage in the upcoming war and win the grail in order to free Sakura and return her to her mother and sister. In the present, at the London Clock Tower, Kayneth Archibald El-Melloi dismisses and humiliates a thesis by one of his students, Waver Velvet, who theorizes anyone can be great mage by hard work and practice other than by their bloodline. Angered by the humiliation, Waver decides to prove his teacher wrong by also joining the Grail War by stealing Kayneth&apos;s artifact needed to summon a Servant and heads to Fuyuki City. As Kirei and Kiritsugu learn of each other&apos;s skills, they are disturbed by how they cannot know what the other man&apos;s goals for the war are. After receiving the scabbard of Excalibur, Iris is now hopeful that they can now summon King Arthur of the Saber class but Kiritsugu worries that Arthur&apos;s chivalry will clash with his pragmatic methods. As Kiritsugu, Tokiomi, Kariya and Waver summoned their servants, Kiritsugu and Iris are stunned to see the summoned King Arthur is actually a girl.</episodePlot>

At his hotel, El-Melloi scolds Lancer for failing to kill Saber but Lancer is defended by Sola-Ui Nuada-Re Sophia-Ri, El-Melloi&apos;s fiance who is maintaining Lancer existences by supplying him with prana, which makes El-Melloi uncomfortable since she has fallen for Lancer due to his magic Love spot.

Elsewhere, Saber and Lancer continue fighting off Caster&apos;s endless waves of demonic creatures due to Caster&apos;s Noble Phantasm, his grimoire.

						<episodePlot>Rider, accompanied by Waver, unexpectedly arrives at the Einzbern Castle on Gordius Wheel. Greeting Saber and Iri, Rider announces he came to have a drink with Saber. Saber accepts and everyone gathers at the castle&apos;s garden, only to be joined by Archer who Rider invited. Archer expresses distaste on the wine Rider brought for them so he brings out a better wine from his collection. As the three discuss Kingship and their wish for the Grail, Saber and Rider have an argument of philosophy over being a King. Saber argues a King should serve for his people and wants to win the Grail to save Britain which she failed in the past but Rider believes it&apos;s the people who should serve for their King and was proud on his reign even when Macedonia fell after his death. Furthermore, Rider criticizes Saber for being a protector to her people rather than a King which lead them to resent her and rebel while his Kingly ambitions made his people love him and inspire them to seek their own ambitions. Their talk is soon interrupted when the Assassins arrive and surround them. When they refuse Rider&apos;s offer to drink with them, Rider transforms into his armor and summons his Noble Phantasm, the Reality Marble &quot;Ionian Hetairoi&quot;, the Armies of Macedonia composed of the soldiers who remained loyal to him and became Servants themselves where they outnumbered the Assassins and proceed to decimate them. With their drink over, Rider departs with Waver but not before saying he no longer recognizes Saber as a King with Archer leaving as well before telling Saber she should stick to her beliefs because her suffering amuses him. Iri rushes to Saber, who reveals she once had a knight who left Camelot because he was dissatisfied with her rule which makes Saber question if the Knights of the Round Table felt the same way.</episodePlot>

						<episodePlot>Kirei discovers Risei&apos;s body and informs Tokiomi. Kirei is saddened over his father&apos;s death, although Archer suggests that his sadness is due to not having the chance to kill his own father himself. Maiya informs Iri and Saber that Tokiomi wishes to discuss an alliance, and Iri agrees to go to the church to discuss the offer. Before his meeting, Tokiomi visits his wife and Rin, giving his daughter a spell book and some wisdom before leaving. During the meeting between Iri and Tokiomi, Tokiomi suggests a temporary alliance to defeat the other contestants first. Iri agrees, but on the condition that Kirei leaves the city and can no longer be involved in the Grail War. Tokiomi complies. As Saber, Iri and Maiya leave the church, a sickly Iri reveals to Maiya that she is actually the embodiment of the Holy Grail in human form and will die to form the Grail once the war ends. Maiya promises to protect her until that time comes. Meanwhile, Kirei is preparing to leave, but reveals to Archer that his father&apos;s dying act was to leave Kirei the remaining Command Seals, restoring Kirei&apos;s ability to be a master in the War. He also reveals the secret reason behind the war; the Holy Grail can be activated only by the sacrifice of seven Heroic Spirits. Thus, even a victorious Servant must die - which is why Tokiomi is reluctant to use his command spells, as he needs at least one to command Archer&apos;s suicide should they be triumphant. Furthermore, Kirei still wants to explore his dark desires, and Archer yearns for a more stimulating master. Later, Kirei meets with Tokiomi, who gives him guardianship of Rin should anything happen to him, and an Azoth dagger as a symbol of his completed apprenticeship. Kirei then stabs Tokiomi in the back with the dagger, telling him that, just like his own father, both men never really understood him. With Tokiomi dead, Archer and Kirei form a new contract as Master and Servant.</episodePlot>

Gon, who got separated from Killua, arrives and hits Hisoka in the face with his fishing rod before he could kill Leorio. After the initial hit, Gon nearly gets strangled by Hisoka, but, after concluding that they have passed his &quot;test&quot; where he roleplayed as an examiner, Hisoka lets them go. He carries an unconscious Leorio off to the second venue, and it is shown that Hisoka is collaborating with an unknown candidate. Gon leaves by himself and finds Kurapika, who had returned and witnessed the entire scene, and they both head for the site of Phase Two of the exam.

The examiners declare the next phase is to test their cooking skills, much to the candidates&apos; disbelief. The test requires pork, so the candidates are sent to find pigs in the forest. However, the pigs living inside the forest are carnivorous and tear through the candidates. Thanks to Gon, they discover the pigs&apos; weakness and they manage to each get one for their cooking. Upon tasting the candidates&apos; cooking, Buhara gives a pass but Menchi fails all of them. Knowing the candidates will riot, Satotz informs Chairman Netoros of the Hunter Selection Committee to make an appearance. Netoros arrives to correct Menchi&apos;s habit of getting biased whenever it&apos;s related to cooking. Netoros allows Menchi to stay on as examiner, and she gives the candidates a retest: boil eggs laid by spider eagles on Mt. Split-in-Half. The candidates ride on Netoros&apos; airship to the mountain where they learn they have to jump down a potentially fatal height to get the eggs. Having seen and learnt how Menchi gets her egg, Gon leads some of the other candidates into successfully getting their own. Some candidates are killed while rashly trying to get their eggs while others refuse to take the leap. Out of the 50 candidates who survive to reach Phase Two, 42 candidates now remain.</episodePlot>

Gon and Killua explore the airship, and Killua tells Gon that he is actually from a family of assassins. He wished to strike out on his own, which his family has not taken lightly. Neteros arrives and tests both boys&apos; instinct and asks how they felt about the difficulty of the exam. Neteros invites both of them to a game, whoever can grab the ball he is holding before dawn will immediately pass the exam. Gon and Killua find it too hard to pass up, but discovers that with Neteros&apos; skills, they are unable to grab the ball. Eventually Killua realizes that with their skills, they will never be able to take the ball from Neteros for a year, if he keeps it up. Killua retires, but then takes it out on two candidates who harass him, by maiming and killing them. Gon continues trying to grab the ball, and uses a headbutt on Neteros. The old man realizes that Gon will crack his skull if he continues with his headbutt, so he uses his right hand to push Gon away from him. Gon then tells Neteros then he has managed to get him to use his right hand once, which he had not used from the start of the challenge.

An experienced rock climber candidate tries to climb down but is eaten by some flying monsters. Later, Kurapika finds that more than half of the candidates have discovered hidden doors to go inside the tower, which Gon finds one as well. However, the catch is that there are many hidden doors, each one can be only used once and only one person can fit through a door, which means they have to split up. When they try out different doors, they realize that they end up in the same room. In the room, Gon&apos;s group are given instructions and special wristwatches for five of them to follow the majority, but they cannot proceed without a fifth member. Lippo, one of the Phase 3 examiners tells them this while explaining they have chosen the path of majority rule. They will need to cooperate in order to pass this phase. Tonpa eventually joins in as the fifth member, and the exam proceeds. By following majority rule, the group eventually reaches an arena, where they have to face prisoners hired by Lippo to become combatants. Lippo explains that to pass, all they have to do is to win three rounds. But the prisoners are given reduced sentences by one year for every hour they manage to keep the candidates here. Tonpa volunteers to go first, pitting himself against a combatant named Bendot. Tonpa immediatey gives up, leading to Leorio accusing him of sabotaging candidates, which he admits to do every year. Kurapika stops Leorio, saying that this is part of their plan to make them fight each other and waste time. Gon goes next against Sedokan, a jailed serial bomber.</episodePlot>

						<episodePlot>Tonpa promptly gives up even before Bendot land a punch on him. Leorio is furious at what he has done but Tonpa tells them that his real plan is to sabotage rookies like them. Gon then faces Sedokan, who proposes a match to see whose candle burns the longest. Gon chooses the longer candle, unaware that it is oil-soaked, and his candle starts to burn faster midway. Seeing that his candle is not susceptible to strong winds, he puts it down and sprints towards Sedokan to blow his candle. The next match is between Kurapika and Majitani, who proposes a death match without weapons and and with the condition that one must die or surrender to finish the match. Majitani, who relies on scaring and intimidating his enemies to make them surrender, is easily defeated by Kurapika when he sees something in Majitani and makes him see red.</episodePlot>

Leorio, and even Killua cannot persuade Kurapika to finish the fight for the latter refuses to fight a person who has lost the will to fight. Frustrated, Leorio decides to use the majority rule as a way out of the difficulty but no one supports him. Elsewhere Hisoka is met by Togari, a former examiner whom Hisoka attacked and is now wanting revenge. Togari attacks with four crescent blades, only to be finished with one sweeping attack. Hisoka then becomes the first applicant to pass this phase. Meanwhile, the team suspects Majitani&apos;s real condition. The female prisoner challenges Leorio to have a betting game instead. Leorio agrees and bets ten hours that Majitani is alive, which he wins. Next, he bets twenty hours on Majitani feigning unconsciousness. To confirm, he brings Majitani to the edge of the platform and threatens to drop him. Seeing that, the prisoner changes her bet to forty hours on Majitani being conscious. When he is about to be dropped by Leorio, Majitani moves and admits defeat, putting the score at 2 - 1 in favor of Leorio&apos;s team. However, they only have 20 hours left to wager</episodePlot>

Leorio thinks that team wins if he is correct; and if he is wrong, he will be able to touch Leroute to confirm. Leorio is wrong and goes on to check Leroute. Leorio then challenges Leroute in rock, paper, scissors, and loses. Killua then faces the feared mass murderer Johness the Dissector. Killua rips Johness&apos; heart in an instant and even have it covered in a piece of Johness&apos; cloth. The latter pleads for his heart, and Killua returned it after he is dead. The team thus gathers three points and pass the trial, but they are forced to wait the 50 hours that Leorio has lost with his bets in a small room.

The Zoldyck family owns the mountain and all of the surrounding forest and the entire region is gated shut. There is a guard outpost immediately outside of the gate, but instead of serving as a guard, the man working in there actually cleans up the mess created by the watchdog whenever there are intruders into the grounds. Gon, unwilling to give up on &quot;rescuing&quot; Killua, learns from the gatekeeper that the actual door is the massive stone gate and anyone who enters via that path will not be attacked by the watchdog. Leorio tries to pull and push on the gate, to no avail. The gatekeeper informs them that the gate opens up different amounts of stone slabs based only on the strength of the person; however, the least amount of strength anyone needs to open the smallest portion of the door requires two tons of strength on each side. In addition, the protagonists are shocked to hear that Killua opened up three doors, making the gate 16 tons, when he arrived home not long ago. Gon&apos;s naturally candid character that allows so many people to like him and to help him out will also play a role in how this episode plays out.</episodePlot>

Encouraged by Senketsu, Ryuko puts him on to help Shinjiro, who reveals himself to be a disguised Nui, having done so to trick Ryuko into donning Senketsu again. Unable to fight at her full strength out of fear of losing control again, Ryuko is defeated by Nui and Senketsu is torn to pieces.

Meanwhile, Aikuro and Tsumugu guide Ryuko and Mako to an undamaged section of their underground base. Aikuro reveals that Life Fibers are what induced humanity&apos;s evolution into Homo sapiens and the instinct to wear clothes. He further explains that Isshin, who founded Nudist Beach, created Senketsu for Ryuko to wear and fight the Kiryuins when she came of age, as she displays a high resistance to Life Fibers. Ryuko becomes outraged that Nudist Beach sees Senketsu as little more than a weapon and takes him off, refusing to let him kill his own kind. Deeming them of no more worth, Tsumugu prepares to kill Ryuko and Senketsu.</episodePlot>

						<episodePlot>Ragyo uses her Shinra-Koketsu&apos;s Absolute Domination ability to negate the effects of everyone&apos;s Kamui and Goku Uniforms before reviving the original Life Fiber. Ragyo attempts to fuse everyone into the original Life Fiber, but Senketsu, who is immune to Ragyo&apos;s ability as he, like Ryuko, is neither human nor clothing, manages to knock Rei out of Shinra-Koketsu, negating its Absolute Domination ability and restoring everyone&apos;s power. This allows the Elite Four and Nudist Beach to destroy the satellite uplink while Ryuko and Satsuki deal a critical blow to Ragyo. However, Nui fuses herself with the original Life Fiber and combines with Ragyo, allowing her to launch into space so she can activate the satellite directly, where she begins her plan to convert the world into a Life Fiber coccoon. After promising to go on a date with Mako when she returns, Ryuko absorbs the combined power of Senketsu, Junketsu, and the Goku Uniforms to form Senketsu Kisaragi, launching into space and fight Ragyo, willingly taking her attacks to provide Senketsu with the power needed to absorb Ragyo&apos;s Absolute Domination ability and eliminate all of the Life Fibers, allowing humans to be humans. After Ragyo ends her own life, Senketsu uses the last of his strength and sacrifices himself to return Ryuko safely to Earth, where she reunites with her friends and family. With the world now free to wear what clothes they want, Ryuko goes on her date with Mako and Satsuki, keeping the memory of Senketsu in her heart.</episodePlot>

						<episodeTitle>A Housecat, a Stray God, and a Tail</episodeTitle>
						<episodeNumber>1</episodeNumber>
						<episodePlot>A god named Yato answers a five-yen prayer to defeat a phantom that has appeared above a school using his Regalia, Tomone. Shortly after the battle, however, Tomone decides she is fed up with Yato and requests to have his contract with him terminated. Now without a Regalia, Yato takes up a new request to find a missing cat named Milord. Whilst he is doing that, a girl named Hiyori Iki spots him walking into the path of an oncoming bus and dives into to save him. She pushes him out of the road but is hit by the bus herself, and afterwards finds her spirit separated from her body, although she is able to return to it safely. Whilst recovering in hospital, Hiyori hears strange voices before having another encounter with Yato, who formerly introduces himself as a god. Some time later, Yato finds Milord but is attacked by the phantom. After Hiyori helps Yato escape, she learns that the incident from before has resulted in her becoming a half-phantom lying between the worlds of the living and the dead, causing her spirit, which has a cat&apos;s tail, to sometimes leave her body. After learning of the situation, Hiyori gives Yato five yen as a fee in order to help her get back to normal.</episodePlot>

In the middle of their talk, Yato is summoned by a suicidal office worker named Usuke Urasawa, whom he accidentally knocks off the top of a building in the process. On the way down, Usuke explains how his luck and fortune went downhill in pursuit of love for a girl, who turns out to be Kofuku, revealed to be a Binbougami (God of Poverty) who causes bad luck and misfortune to those around her. Yato manages to use Yukine to sever Usuke&apos;s ties and memories to Kofuku, before ensuring he lands safely. After Yato collects his payment, Kofuku tells Hiyori that Yato had once killed before. Later, as Yato tells Hiyori to go to Kofuku and Daikoku should anything happen to him, Yukine encounters a strange woman, who is revealed to be Nora--Yato&apos;s former Regalia.</episodePlot>

The next day, Yukine runs away after Hiyori stops him from stealing a skateboard, with Yato later explaining to her that any impure thoughts Yukine has results in pain for himself. Whilst running away, Yukine encounters a little girl, which he later learns to be the spirit of a girl who died in a traffic accident.

						<episodePlot>Daikoku and Kofuku only allow Hiyori to come through the borderline so she can cleanse her blight, stating that Yato will die unless Yukine receives punishment by ablution. Although Daikoku manages to enlist the help of Mayu, he struggles to find a third Regalia to help perform the ablution. Rejecting the thought of calling on Nora, as she might kill Yukine, Hiyori goes to Bishamon&apos;s shrine to request Kazuma&apos;s help. As the three Regalias get together, they discover Yukine&apos;s back is covered with phantoms and begin their ablution, in which Yukine must endure pain until he confesses to his sins, or otherwise transform into a phantom himself. Yukine admits his crimes and expresses his jealousy of the living and his envy of what they have. As Yukine&apos;s condition worsens, Hiyori and Yato calls out to him, reminding him that they are his friends, and the name Yato gave him is that of a person&apos;s. Hearing this, Yukine apologises for all the bad things he had done, allowing the ablution to be successfully carried out. With both Yato and Yukine back to normal, they both feel thankful towards Hiyori for saving their lives. Meanwhile, Nora has awakened a spirit named Rabo, who has a grudge against Yato.</episodePlot>

Meanwhile, Tenjin informs Yato, who finally contemplates fulfilling Hiyori&apos;s request, that he may be able to fix her problem if he cuts his ties with her. On New Year&apos;s Day, as Yato and Yukine fight a group of phantoms, Hiyori, who was on a shrine visit with her friends, is lured out by Nora, who sends her own phantoms to chase after her. As Hiyori is saved as the phantoms are dissolved by dawn&apos;s sunlight, Nora informs her about Rabo and his desire to kill Yato, telling her to stop existing. After Yato and Yukine manage to defeat all the phantoms, they catch up to Hiyori, only to find she has no memory of who Yato is.</episodePlot>

						<episodePlot>As Yato and Yukine try to figure out how to restore Hiyori&apos;s memories, they are confronted by Nora, who reveals she had stolen Hiyori&apos;s memory of Yato and has become Furuhime, regalia of Rabo, who attacks Yato in an attempt to awaken some repressed memories. As Yato finds himself unable to beat Rabo and Furuhime, the two take their leave, with Furuhime stating she will return Hiyori&apos;s memory if Yato can defeat Rabo. It is revealed that Rabo is a calamity god, a god who answers malicious wishes to kill people, phantoms, and gods, who once worked alongside Yato, who was also a calamity god himself. As Yato becomes conflicted over whether restoring Hiyori&apos;s memory is the right thing to do, Yukine shows Hiyori a picture book detailing the times they have spent together. Meanwhile, Furuhime reveals that Hiyori&apos;s memory is further waning, shown when she loses her memory of Yukine, and will leave her as an empty vessel if nothing is done. Despite knowing the risks involved, Yato and Yukine resolve to restore Hiyori&apos;s memory.</episodePlot>

						<episodePlot>Yato and Yukine warp over to Rabo&apos;s shrine, mistakenly dragging Hiyori along with them. Yato immediately engages Rabo and Furuhime, only to be easily fended off and taken prisoner by a spell of Rabo&apos;s which enshrouds the victim in a sphere of water. Hiyori manages to pull Yato out, allowing the fight to resume. Unsatisfied with Yato&apos;s performance, Rabo decides to destroy the jewel-like sphere containing Hiyori&apos;s stolen memories, causing her to fall unconscious. Angered by this, Yato appears to awaken to his former self as a god of calamity, and easily kicks Rabo into the stone cliff surrounding the site. Having seen that Yato had returned to his old self, Rabo absorbs the storm which had been raging from above, thus merging with its phantoms. An exchange between the two causes boulders to loosen, one of which heads directly for Hiyori. Yato saves her just in time, and holds her tightly to his body in a protective gesture. Hiyori&apos;s memories are awakened by his scent, and she returns to consciousness. Realizing he has to get rid of Hiyori, Rabo takes hold of her, but is finished off by Yato and Yukine with a move used for cleansing phantoms. As the three make their way back home, Hiyori tells Yato and Yukine that she never wants to sever her ties with them.</episodePlot>

						<episodePlot>Our perfectly calibrated, breathing planet. For those privileged few who have seen Earth from space, the very first thing they notice is the thin blue line of atmosphere that clings to our planet and sustains life. The story of how the Earth creates and regulates that oxygen is mind-blowing. From snowflakes in the arctic to plankton, desert sandstorms, and rivers in the sky; an incredible chain of connections reveal just how incredible our home is. Everything connects so life and planet breathe together.</episodePlot>

We discover the moments that could have destroyed us, but instead made our planet what it is.</episodePlot>

						<episodePlot>Earth gives birth to life. The building blocks of life are common across the universe, but life is rare. What’s so special about Earth that it emerged here? Only here on Earth have we found the elixir of life; water in its three forms. But for life to emerge this isn’t enough… huge tides created by the proximity of our perfect Moon, plate tectonics, volcanoes and lightning mean the Earth is a dynamic planet. It’s a huge planetary chemical experiment, a bubbling cauldron that transforms dead minerals into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA); the code for all life.</episodePlot>

						<episodePlot>Earth, the great killer. Without the cycle of death and sacrifice, from cellular to planetary, life would not be here. From the deaths of stars, to planetary scale mass extinctions and the sacrifice of individuals for a greater genetic good, this is the story of how life evolved hand in hand with death. Death drives evolution. It’s hardwired: from our cells to our landscapes, our colorful living planet is only possible thanks to it. Death leads to opportunity and biodiversity which ironically ensures life on the planet is never wiped out. It’s not enough for our planet to be habitable… it also has to be lethal.</episodePlot>

Or are we destined for extinction like 99% of all species before us? Our best chance of survival may be to escape from the land and build another colony elsewhere. But there are real barriers: space radiation, microgravity and bacteria within us will conspire against us. And our DNA is encoded for the conditions here on earth, so if we ever manage to colonize another planet, those that are born there will evolve into another species.</episodePlot>

						<episodePlot>Earth’s great paradox. For our planet to become inhabitable for life, you already need life. Ever since life emerged, microbes, plants and animals have all sculpted the planet’s surface and air in the strangest of ways; fish poop creates islands; dead animals create mountains; lichen drive continents. But life also has the power to destroy our world. We are changing the climate, but we are not the first to do so. Long before us, microbes froze the planet and almost wiped out all life. The difference between us and them is we are conscious of our actions.</episodePlot>

So even if we do find alien life, what are the chances of that life being complex – like us? Vanishingly rare… on our strange rock, it’s all down to a freak event, which accidentally happened when one cell ate another to create a kind of cellular power pack: mitochondria. This almost miraculous event transforms earth into a complex interconnected food web based on a competition for food. And at the top of the pyramid sits us humans.</episodePlot>

						<episodePlot>The narration describes the story of Doctor Genus, brilliant young scientist with ideas of artificially evolving humanity becoming disillusioned with the world, eventually discovering the secret to immortality and creating multiple clones of himself. Saitama cuts off the narration in his impatience and Armored Gorilla then explains that Doctor Genus wants Saitama for his experiments. Genos and Saitama decide to attack immediately, since the store discount day is the next day. Before they leave, Genos asks Armored Gorilla about any cyborgs active four years ago that have destroyed any towns, which Armored Gorilla denies. In preparation for Saitama&apos;s arrival, the House of Evolution sets traps in their facility and reluctantly decide to release Asura Rhino. Once they arrive, Genos destroys the above-ground facility with a single blast before heading underground. The released Asura Rhino fights with Genos, taking no damage in the process. Asura Rhino then faces off against Saitama, but backs off when he detects how powerful Saitama really is. Saitama then reveals to the room his somewhat mundane daily training regime of 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats and 10 km of running, much to Genos&apos;s disbelief. Asura Rhino unleashes his Asura Mode and appears to be beating Saitama back, but it transpires that Saitama was just shocked by the realization that the store discount day was that day instead of the next and defeats Asura Rhino easily, leaving soon after with Genos to catch the rest of the discount day. Having witnessed this, Doctor Genus abandons his plans of artificial evolution. After the credits, officials from the Heroes Association inspect the House of Evolution blast site and discuss Genos&apos;s destructive power.</episodePlot>

						<episodeTitle>Prologue of the Beginning and Ending</episodeTitle>
						<episodeNumber>1</episodeNumber>
						<episodePlot>Self-proclaimed mad scientist, Rintarō Okabe, goes to a seminar on time travel with his friend, Mayuri Shiina. Whilst there, he meets a girl named Kurisu Makise who explicitly states that he had met her 15 minutes ago, despite having never met her before. Later on, Rintarō hears a scream and discovers Kurisu had been stabbed. As he sends a text to another one of his research buddies, Hashida Itaru, Rintarō experiences a strange experience and finds the street he is on has suddenly become deserted and a strange sattelite had crashed into the building he was just in. Later on, whilst fiddling about with their strange remote-controlled microwave, which turns bananas into a gel-like substance, Hashida tells Rintarō that the seminar he supposedly attended was cancelled, much to his surprise. Rintarō later discovers that the text he sent to Hashida had been sent to a week ago, just before encountering Kurisu, who is alive and well.</episodePlot>

After getting some provisions from crossdresser Ruka Urushibara and meeting Suzuha Amane, who gets hired to work part time in the electronic&apos;s shop below his apartment, Rintarō investigates the supposedly altered events and learns of a man calling himself John Titor who claims to be a time traveller. Rintarō then discovers the books he had on John Titor had disappeared as if they never existed. The next day, Rintarō encounters a strange woman named Moeka Kiryū who asks for information on a retro PC, which Rintarō gathers from Hashida. Later, whilst testing a banana on their microwave which then disappears, Rintarō and Hashida find the banana reattached to the bunch it came from in its gelled state, before Kurisu appears before them once again.</episodePlot>

They discover that Hashida was using the microwave at the time Rintarō sent his text about Kurisu&apos;s stabbing. Despite the microwave causing a large electrical discharge when Mayuri opens it in the middle of operating, Rintarō concludes that the mobile microwave is, in fact, a time machine. After hearing about the large hadron collider and micro-black-holes, Rintarō asks Hashida to hack into CERN&apos;s network. There, they discover they had already been performing micro-black-hole experiments, kept hidden from the public, which reveals that humans had died during them.</episodePlot>

After Mayuri hears from her co-worker, Feiris Nyannyan, that she knows about the IBN-5100, Rintarō plays a game before learning that the computer is at the shrine where Ruka works.

After Hashida gets the IBN 5100 working, he, Rintarō and Kurisu begin deciphering SERN&apos;s reports. They discover that they had indeed been experimenting with time travel, with their attempts of sending humans back in time resulting in the same jellification Rintarō had performed on the bananas.

Later, Rintarō discovers that the IBN-5100 has gone missing, as if they never found it in the first place, most likely as a result of Moeka&apos;s D-Mail. After learning that the IBN-5100 had been previously taken from Ruka&apos;s shrine, Rintarō finds Moeka in town, but she doesn&apos;t know where the IBN-5100 is either. Rintarō also finds out that Ruka&apos;s D-Mail has caused Mayuri to know Moeka in this timeline. Rintarō, Hashida and Mayuri go to see Rumiho, whose family owns Akihabara and originally donated the IBN-5100 to the shrine. She offers them a replacement in exchange for being allowed to send a D-Mail ten years into the past. As history is changed again, the IBN-5100 was never donated to the shrine and, more disturbingly, the face of Akihabara has completely changed, no longer being a mecca for anime.</episodePlot>

Afterwards, Rintarō talks with Suzuha, who revealed she came to Tokyo to try and find her estranged father, mentioning she will leave if she is unable to find him the next day. As Rintarō contemplates holding a party for her, offering the chance to send a D-Mail if she fails, he receives a text message letting him know that someone is watching him. Mayuri mentions how Rintarō fell sick when he was younger, which he believes to be the origins of his &apos;Reading Steiner&apos;, his ability to travel between world lines with his memories intact. That night, after some mishaps in preparing the party, Suzuha doesn&apos;t show and simply sends a farewell text to Rintarō. He decides to send a D-Mail to himself telling him to follow her, changing history so she ended up attending the party and staying in Tokyo. In this new timeline, the satellite that had crashed into a building in Akihabara has mysteriously disappeared.</episodePlot>

						<episodePlot>Rintarō discovers that a television in the electronics shop below the lab is the key to the time slot in which D-Mails can be sent. Kurisu then theorises that it might be possible to send memories back in time in the same manner as D-Mails, effectively allowing people to &apos;leap&apos; to the past. As Rintarō goes into town with Mayuri to look for parts Kurisu needs, running into Moeka along the way, Suzuha tells Rintarō that Kurisu works for SERN, though Kurisu denies this when asked. Kurisu tells Rintarō about the troubles she has with her father, who grew to hate her when she surpassed him in scientific prowess, though cheers up when Rintarō offers to help them reunite. As Mayuri and Kurisu decide to have a sleepover at the lab, Rintarō receives another sinister text message warning him that he knows too much, later learning that the lab is connected to the SERN network without the lab members&apos; knowing.</episodePlot>

As a bomb threat is televised, Suzuha, after hearing about the lab&apos;s connection to SERN, suspects something is terribly wrong and leaves. Just then, the lab is attacked by a group of armed men, led by Moeka who reveals herself to be from SERN. Demanding Rintarō, Kurisu and Hashida hand over the time machine and come with her, she decides Mayuri isn&apos;t needed and kills her.</episodePlot>

By the time they try to escape the area, the bomb threat has stopped the subway and Mayuri is killed when Moeka runs her over with a car. Rintarō manages to escape the clutches of SERN and leaps to the past again. Using his knowledge of Mayuri&apos;s movements from his previous leap, he manages to find her sooner and they visit a different subway station. However, Mayuri dies again when Mr Braun&apos;s daughter, Nae, accidentally pushes her in the way of an oncoming train.

In one of those leaps, Rintarō calls out Moeka and holds her at gunpoint, making her reveal that SERN have targeted the lab due to the creation of the time machine and their plan to publicly announce it. As Rintarō falls further into despair, Kurisu gets him to reveal what he knows and offers to help him try to save Mayuri. She sends Rintarō to just before she completed the time leap machine, where he tells her past self what he knows. As they discuss what the cause of Mayuri&apos;s death could be, they are greeted by Suzuha, who tells them that in order to save Mayuri, they need to find a specific World Line. She takes them to the crashed satellite, which turns out to be her time machine, and reveals she is &quot;John Titor&quot; and has come from the year 2036.</episodePlot>

She explains she plans to travel to 1975 to acquire an IBN-5100, but soon discovers her time machine has broken down as a result of the storm on the night Rintarō stopped her from leaving. Rintarō leaps two days before the completion of the time leap machine in order to get Hashida to help fix Suzuha&apos;s time machine, whilst Mayuri suggests they also help find Suzuha&apos;s father, using his badge as a clue. Suzuha gives Rintarō her Divergence Meter, which keeps track of the magnitude of differences between timelines, and tells him about how he founded the resistance against SERN in the future. After spending the day searching for Suzuha&apos;s father, Suzuha gives her thanks to Rintarō before he receives a lead on Suzuha&apos;s father from a badge maker.</episodePlot>

Hashida then mentions that Suzuha&apos;s time machine is only able to travel backwards in time. As the repairs to the time machine are completed, Mayuri deduces from the time machine&apos;s naming convention that Suzuha&apos;s father is actually Hashida. After a short reunion, Suzuha travels back to 1975, though Rintarō notices the Divergence Meter&apos;s reading hasn&apos;t changed. Later, Mr. Braun delivers a letter from Suzuha from the year 2000, mentioning that she commited suicide a year later. In the letter, Suzuha laments that she failed her mission, as the damaged time machine caused her to lose her memories for 24 years. Rintarō blames himself for stopping her on the night of the party and, despite Mayuri&apos;s pleas, sends a D-Mail that stops him from following Suzuha, letting her use the time machine before it was damaged. Speaking with Mr. Braun again, Rintarō learns that Suzuha has died of illness instead, leaving behind her Divergence Meter. Noticing a small change in divergence, Rintarō returns home and finds Mayuri has not been killed by Moeka.</episodePlot>

						<episodePlot>Despite the change in divergence, Mayuri&apos;s death still takes place, albeit a day later than in previous timelines. Rintarō asks for Kurisu&apos;s help, who theorises that, since negating Rintarō&apos;s D-Mail about Suzuha delayed the attack, undoing the effects of the other D-Mails could bring them back to a World Line where they have an IBN-5100, letting them hack into SERN and delete the records that set them on Rintarō&apos;s trail. Rintarō starts by trying to figure out how to reverse Rumiho&apos;s D-Mail, while helping her evade a rival gaming gang. Rintarō takes Rumiho to the place where her maid cafe used to be and tells her about the way Akihabara was. Rumiho comes to remember the previous timeline and the D-Mail she sent: a fake ransom note, which prevented her father from boarding a plane fated to crash. The rival gang catches up to them but they are rescued by the arrival of Rumiho&apos;s father. Speaking to him, Rintarō learns that Suzuha gave him the IBN-5100, but he was forced to sell it in order to pay for the fake kidnapping&apos;s ransom. After accepting the reality of her father&apos;s death, Rumiho agrees to send a D-Mail cancelling out her previous one, turning Akihabara back into a moe hub. The IBN-5100, however, still remains out of reach.</episodePlot>

While she initially disbelieves him, ultimately she agrees, on the condition that Rintarō takes her on a date. Despite Kurisu and Hashida&apos;s advice on dating, Rukako and Rintarō spend the evening in awkward conversation. Like Rumiho, Ruka eventually recalls the previous timeline, which makes her even more depressed at the impending return to it, since she feels she will be unable to pursue her feelings about Rintarō as a guy. Before sending the D-Mail that will cancel out Ruka&apos;s first one, Rintarō realises that the reason she didn&apos;t enjoy their date was that he was trying to be someone he&apos;s not. He visits the shrine and tells her that, no matter what, she&apos;ll always be his &quot;student&quot;. With their relationship repaired, the world line shifts, turning Ruka back into a guy and leaving only one more D-Mail to be reversed: Moeka&apos;s.</episodePlot>

Rintarō confronts Moeka about FB and tells her about her future suicide.

As they observe the IBN-5100 being taking out, they follow it as it is passed along to several people, including Mr. Braun, before it ends up on a plane towards France. Rintarō, Moeka and Kurisu go to confront Mr. Braun, who reveals himself to be FB, killing Moeka before taking his own life. Rintarō uses Braun&apos;s cell phone to cancel out Moeka&apos;s D-Mail, returning to a World Line where both Moeka and Braun are alive and he possesses the IBN-5100. As Rintarō gets Hashida to hack into the SERN network to erase the data they have on them, he comes to sudden realisation that he needs to undo an additional D-Mail: the one that prevented Kurisu from getting stabbed.</episodePlot>

As a car appears during Mayuri&apos;s fated time to die, Rintarō attempts to change her destiny by letting the car hit him instead, but Mayuri ends up dying trying to save him. After he leaps back in time, Kurisu has Rintarō reveal to her that she dies in the Beta World Line.

As Rintaro attempts to save Kurisu, he inadvertently stabs her himself, allowing Nakamachi to escape with her theory and bring it to Russia. Returning to the present, Rintaro falls into despair but Mayuri knocks some sense into him. Afterwards, Rintaro receives a video mail from his future self, telling him that the key to saving Kurisu without changing the events that led him to create a time machine is to fool his other self into believing Kurisu had died.</episodePlot>

In this new timeline, Rintaro goes around giving badges to his past lab members, eventually managing to meet Kurisu once again; she was looking for Rintaro to thank him for saving her life, suggesting that the event of their romance doesn&apos;t disappear, either.</episodePlot>

						<episodeTitle>The World of Swords</episodeTitle>
						<episodeNumber>1</episodeNumber>
						<episodePlot>On November 6, 2022, the VRMMORPG, Sword Art Online (SAO), is officially released, with 10,000 copies released and sold immediately. Kirito, who beta-tested the game, logs-in to the world of Aincrad and meets Klein, a new player, who asks him to teach him the basics of the game including the Sword Skill battle system. Later, after several hours in the game, Kirito and Klein discover that they cannot log out. Shortly after, the pair are teleported to the town square, where they see that all other players have also been transported to the location. A red-hooded Game Master then appears in the sky and reveals himself to the crowd as Akihiko Kayaba, the game&apos;s creator. He tells them that he intentionally removed the log-out option. He cautions that they cannot log-out by simply removing the NerveGear, the VR helmet they use to log-in the game, as it will kill them instantly. The only way to log out is for the players to beat and clear all 100 floors of the game. Should they die in the game, their real bodies will perish as well. As a parting gift, Akihiko gives them a mirror that alters their in-game avatars to resemble their real appearance. Kirito asks Klein to follow him to the next town to level up before resources are depleted, but Klein politely declines as he wishes to remain with his friends. Kirito then heads out, vowing to be free from the game. By the end of the first month, 2,000 players have died and the 1st floor has yet to be cleared.</episodePlot>

						<episodePlot>One month since the start of the fun-turned-deadly game, 2,000 players have already died, and the first floor has yet to be cleared. Kirito attends a meeting organized by fellow beta-tester Diabel, who announces to the attendants that his party, a group of characters adventuring together in a role-playing game, has found Illfang the Kobold Lord, the boss of the first floor. Parties are formed, and Kirito teams up with a young girl named Asuna. The next day, Diabel&apos;s raid group arrives at the boss&apos; room and battles Illfang and his minions. When Illfang&apos;s health becomes low, Diabel goes for the finishing attack. Kirito attempts to warn him, but Illfang attacks down first and mortally wounds Diabel. As he dies, Diabel begs Kirito to defeat the boss and save the players. Though they destroy the boss, Kirito is accused of being a &quot;beater&quot;—a combination of a &quot;beta-tester&quot; and &quot;cheater&quot;—for Diabel&apos;s death.</episodePlot>

						<episodePlot>Four months have past with more powerful players and guilds clearing the game&apos;s floors. After saving a guild called the &quot;Moonlit Black Cats&quot;, a group of friends from the same school club, their leader Keita thanks Kirito and ask him to join their guild and teach the only female in their guild, Sachi, to fight better. Kirito agrees while hiding the fact he is at least Level 40, twice higher than the others as they slowly and safely level up at low-level floors that have been cleared. Kirito bonds with his new friends, especially Sachi, who admits to Kirito she&apos;s afraid to die which he assures her he will protect her and they will be free one day. But on June 12, 2023, as Keita goes to buy a house for the guild, against their usual methods and Kirito&apos;s advice, the Black Cats decide to earn some money by going to the upper floors where they set off a trap, locking them in a room with higher level Mobs. Kirito desperately tries to save his friends but they are killed one by one until Sachi is the last to fall. Blaming himself over his friends death, including Keita, who committed suicide upon learning what happen, Kirito goes on a suicidal quest upon learning a rumor there is a way to revive the dead. On December 24, 2023, Argo the informant reveals to Kirito the location of a special boss named Nicholas the Renegade who has an item that can revive the dead. As Kirito heads there, he is followed by Klein and his guild, who fears for his safety. They are soon surrounded by the Holy Dragon Alliance guild who are also after the item. As Klein and his guild hold off the Holy Dragons, Kirito faces against Nicholas alone. But much to his distraught, Kirito discovers the item can only revive the dead within ten seconds after their deaths. To Kirito&apos;s surprise, he receives a recorded message from Sachi. Sent to him on Christmas Eve in the event of her death, Sachi tells Kirito not to blame himself over her death and that he should continue living to be free from the game. As she ends the message by humming &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; before saying goodbye, Kirito sadly cries.</episodePlot>

						<episodeNumber>5</episodeNumber>
						<episodePlot>During a meeting between guilds and players on March 6, 2024 on the 56th floor, Asuna, who has now become Vice Commander of the Knights of Blood Oath guild, propose a plan to lure a boss they are fighting into a village but is opposed by Kirito, as the NPC villagers will be killed. A month later on the 59th floor, Kirito is taking a nap until Asuna arrives, criticizing him for being lazy but he convinces her to relax as well. To thank him for guarding her while she was asleep, Asuna decided to buy lunch for him at a town on the 57th floor. However, they discovered a player killed, hanging outside the church, impaled with a spear. As they both investigate, Kirito wonders how the player was killed in a safezone unless he was dueled by another player or someone has found an exploit to kill players. Yoruko, a girl who was a friend of the victim, Kains, saw someone behind Kains before he was hanged. Asuna and Kirito heads towards Egil&apos;s shop to help them find clues on the murder weapon, which Egil learns it&apos;s a custom made weapon by a player named Grimrock. Explaining what they discovered to Yoruko, she reveals how she and Kains are related to Grimrock. Six months ago, she, Kains and Grimrock were part of a eight-man guild called the Golden Apple lead by Griselda, Grimrock&apos;s ingame wife. One day the guild acquired a rare ring and voted whether to use it or sell it, with three members, Yoruko, Kains and Schmit, now a member of the Holy Dragon Alliance, voting to use it. Griselda went out to sell the ring but was killed. Yoruko believes the killer is targeting the three of them as he suspect they were involved in Griselda&apos;s death. After getting Schmit and explaining to him everything, Yoruko becomes paranoid, believing Griselda&apos;s ghost wants revenge against them. But Yoruko is killed after someone throws a dagger from outside.</episodePlot>

Kirito is still unsure how it was possible to kill someone in a safezone which a paranoid Schmit thinks Griselda&apos;s ghost is really after him. After accidentally seeing a dropped sandwich vanishing and talking with Asuna about the game&apos;s marriage system which allows both couples to share each others inventory, Kirito finally figures out how Yoruko and Kains &quot;died&quot; and who is Griselda&apos;s killer. It turns out Yoruko and Kains are still alive and tricked people into thinking they were dead by using damaged armor that will eventually disappear along with teleport crystals at the same time to make it look like they died. Yoruko and Kains confront Schmit at Griselda&apos;s grave as they are investigating who Griselda&apos;s killer is. After Schmit explains he had no part in Griselda&apos;s death, the three of them are surrounded by the notorious player-killing guild, the Laughing Coffins, who have come to kill them. They are soon rescued by the timely arrival of Kirito, which the Laughing Coffins retreat and Asuna arrives with the man who hired them and Griselda&apos;s killer, Grimrock. Grimrock reveals he killed Griselda, who was also his wife in the real world, because he couldn&apos;t accept his kind, dutiful wife he loved now became a fearless, independent leader. Asuna shoots back on Grimrock for killing Griselda, telling him he didn&apos;t love his wife but was just obsessed with her. After Yoruko, Kains and Schmit take Grimrock into custody, Kirito and Asuna talks about marriage and how he would still love his partner after seeing a different side of her, they see Griselda&apos;s ghost, who thanks them.</episodePlot>

Later, Kirito arrives at Liz&apos;s shop as he&apos;s looking for a custom-made sword to buy. Much to Liz&apos;s shock, Kirito&apos;s sword Elucidator easily breaks her strongest sword. Angry and her pride hurt, Liz convinces Kirirto to let her join him to the Western Mountain on the 55th floor to get a rare mineral from a dragon that eats crystals so she can use the mineral to make a stronger sword. As they arrive at the Western Mountain, Kirito advises Liz to hide as he fights the dragon. However, she ignores his advice when she comes out when she thinks the dragon is almost defeated. The dragon blows her into a deep pit and Kirito jumps in to save her. While they both survive, they can&apos;t get out of the pit and are forced to sleep there for the night. Liz asks Kirito to hold her hand while they sleep, which brings her to realize that she can feel another person&apos;s warmth even though they are just data. She also realizes that she has feelings for him. The next morning, Kirito discovers that the mineral they are seeking, a Crystallite Ingot, is under the snow as the hole is the dragon&apos;s nest. The dragon returns and Kirito grabs Liz with him as he stabs the dragon&apos;s back, forcing it to carry them out of the hole before jumping out. Now safe with the mineral, Liz manages to create a new sword for Kirito, Dark Repulsor. As she asks Kirito to use her as his exclusive smith and is about to confess to him, a worried Asuna arrives. Realizing Kirito is the boy Asuna likes, Liz excuses herself from them. As Liz cries over her heartbreak, Kirito finds her and tries to comfort her. Accepting her predicament, Liz promises to help Kirito as his smith if he promises to win the game and free them all.</episodePlot>

Asuna warns Kirito to be careful about fighting Heathcliff as he has an unique skill called Divine Blade which gives him maximum strength and defense. Heathcliff at first is able to overpower Kirito but the tides turn when Kirito forces Heathcliff on the defensive. Just as Kirito is about to deal the winning strike, Heathcliff mysteriously manages to dodge it and defeats Kirito. Now a member of the Knights of Blood, Kirito is asked by Asuna why he never join guilds and he reveals what happened to his old guild. Asuna comforts Kirito and tells him she will protect him. Later, Kirito is asked by fellow member Godfrey to follow him and a seemingly remorseful Kuradeel to the 55th floor dungeons for a skill assessment. As they take a lunch break, Kirito notices too late that the water he and Godfrey drank contains a paralysis effect. Kuradeel reveals he is a member of the Laughing Coffins and how he plans to kill both Godfrey and Kirito while making it look like they were killed in an ambush. After he finishes off Godfrey, Kuradeel attempts to kill Kirito but is saved from certain death by the arrival of Asuna who tracked them on her map. Asuna quickly decimates Kuradeel&apos;s health until critical stages. Kuradeel begs Asuna for forgiveness which is a ruse. When Kuradeel&apos;s is about to attack Asuna, Kirito jumps in between them, blocking the attack with his arm before killing him. Asuna feels guilty for what happened but Kirito calms her by kissing her, telling her how much he cares about her and wants to protect her. They agree to a take break from adventuring and stay at her home for the night. Later, as he sits next to Asuna at her bed, Kirito tells of a place they can be alone together and proposes to her, which she happily accepts.</episodePlot>

During their meal, Nishida mentions a huge fish he tried to catch many times but failed and asks Kirito to help him. Nishida manages to hook the fish and gives the rod to Kirito to pull it away. The fish is revealed to be a huge monster whom Asuna slays.

As the time for the battle approaches, Kirito asks Asuna to stay behind fearing for her safety, but Asuna refuses, claiming that she&apos;d rather die than live without him. She also mentions that all players&apos; real bodies must be currently being treated in hospitals and their condition cannot be kept indefinetly, thus fleeing to live by themselves inside the game is out of question.

Akihiko paralyses everyone except Kirito, and then offers Kirito the chance to face him in a one-on-one duel where, should Kirito win, Akihiko would log out all the remaining players. After giving his best wishes to the others, Kirito accepts the challenge but is unable to overcome Akihiko&apos;s absolute defense and intimate understanding of the game&apos;s mechanics. As Akihiko readies the finishing blow, Asuna overcomes her paralysis and takes the hit instead, losing all her HP and disappearing as a result. Distraught by Asuna&apos;s death, Kirito loses the will to fight and receives a fatal stab from Akihiko.

Akihiko informs Kirito and Asuna that he has logged out all the other players as promised, and also explains his motives for creating Sword Art Online before disappearing.

Later, Kazuto goes to the hospital to visit Asuna who, along with 300 other players, has yet to wake up even after the SAO incident. It is there that he meets an associate of Asuna&apos;s father, Noboyuki Sugou, who reveals to Kazuto that he intends to be adopted into Asuna&apos;s family while she is still comatose as a precursor to marriage, much to Kazuto&apos;s fury. Claiming this as his right since that it was his company that had been keeping Asuna alive after SAO&apos;s developer went bankrupt, he informs Kazuto that the ceremony will occur in a week and tells him not to see her again. Later at home, Kazuto breaks down before Suguha, who tells him not to give up, despite harboring her own feelings for him.

He also discovers that he still has the SAO in-game item containing Yui&apos;s data, which he activates to bring Yui into ALfheim as a Navigation Pixie. Yui deduces that the game is made using a copy of SAO&apos;s servers, which was why all common skills and stats from SAO had been carried over to Kirito&apos;s ALfheim avatar.

Seeing that they have no chance against them, Leafa thanks Kirito for all he has done for her and asks him to continue to the tree by himself, but he rushes forward and stands before the Salamander General Eugene instead, bluffing that he is a messenger for the Spriggans and Undines and to attack them would lead to the four factions waging war against the Salamanders. Eugene does not believe him and challenges him to a duel claiming that he may trust his word should he manage to hold himself for thirty seconds. Kirito is severely punished by Eugene&apos;s sword which can bypass his defenses, until he conjures a huge smokescreen, making use of it to steal Leafa&apos;s sword and turn the tides of the battle fighting Eugene with two swords. After Eugene is defeated, he is revived by Sakuya and leaves in peace with his army. Having his treason exposed, Sigurd is contacted by Sakuya who strips him of his title and has him banished from the Sylph territory. After learning that the now allied Sylphs and Cait Siths plan an incursion to the World Tree in a couple of days, Kirito donates a large sum of money to aid in their war effort and departs ahead with Leafa. Meanwhile, Asuna makes use of the code she had previously learned to open the cage and escape.</episodePlot>

A month later, Kazuto Kirigaya is called to meet up with Kikuoka Seijiro of the Ministry of Internal Affairs&apos; Virtual Division, who reveals that Zexceed&apos;s user was found dead of acute heart failure a few days after his avatar was shot, also showing evidence of a similar case involving the death of a GGO user. As Kazuto states his doubts that a game could cause someone&apos;s heart to fail, Kikuoka, believing Death Gun is specifically targeting professional GGO players, asks Kazuto to once again take up the role of Kirito and investigate what is causing the victims to die. Remembering all the people who died in SAO, Kazuto thinks over his decision whilst spending time with Asuna at the park.

After talking about their personal lives, Shino leaves for home. There, she tries holding a gun replica, but this induces a flashback to when she was eleven years old; while she was at a postal office with her mother, a man carrying a gun tried to rob the office, shooting an employee and threatening to kill other people.

He explains that he wants to find directions to the Governors Office to sign up for BOB, &quot;Bullets on Bullets&quot; an intense PvP game mode. Sinon is happy to help and directs Kazuto towards a Market to buy weaponry/armor. Being strapped for cash, Sinon offers him money but he declines and asks if there&apos;s a fast way to earn it himself. There happened to be one game; &quot;Untouchable&quot; a QuickDraw game where the player must dodge the NPC gun mans bullets and tag him to receive all the credits anybody has ever put in. Sinon tells him it&apos;s rigged but Kazuto believes nobody ever had the skills to defeat it, so when witnessing a player fail, Kazuto is determined to win, and his agility and training from SAO allows him to dodge with ease thus winning all the earnings. Back at the weapon shop Sinon is recommending guns but Kazuto is interested in an energy sword which he purchases immediately, although Sinon persists he at least buy a handgun to distract enemies to gain &quot;Sword Range&quot;.

Kirito then has a flashback to his time in SAO, when he and several others battled Laughing Coffin, and notes that he killed two members during that battle. He then realizes that the player who confronted him was actually Death Gun. Sinon later meets up with him and senses that something is wrong, but before Kirito can confide in her, he is teleported to his next duel, which he wins. Eventually, both Kirito and Sinon have made it into the finals. While waiting for Kirito, Sinon begins to feel he is just like her. She becomes frustrated when Kirito calmly walks straight toward her position, not showing any signs of wanting to dodge her bullet. Sinon fires at him repeatedly, but misses, and she personally confronts him about it. Remembering the promise he made to Sinon, Kirito apologizes and sets the rules for a rematch: he would move away by ten meters, and they would start fighting once he throws a bullet to the ground. Despite Sinon&apos;s Hecate&apos;s one-hundred percent hit rate at such a range, Kirito shows his confidence in his abilities. When the rematch begins, Kirito is able to slice Sinon&apos;s bullet in half and hold her at the tip of his Photon Sword. Realizing that Kirito predicted the bullet path by watching her eyes, Sinon realizes that his strength goes beyond a virtual game and asks him what he is afraid of. He implies to her his experiences in SAO are not strength, but skill. He then asks her to surrender, since he doesn&apos;t want to defeat a girl. In anger, she does so, stating that next time would be different.</episodePlot>

She and Kirito then decide to follow Death Gun, eventually going to the Lost City. However, since they could not find him along the way, they look for him during the next scan. Seeing that two players, Sterben and Juushi X (銃士Ｘ, Jūshi X?), were present in the city, they decide to go after Juushi X, as his name sounded like Death Gun (死銃, Shijū?) backwards. During the scan, they find Juushi X at a stadium, while Sterben abruptly vanishes from the city. The two rush to the stadium and, after confirming that there was a sniper, decide to split up. However, as Sinon takes a sniping position, she is suddenly shot with a stun bullet. Death Gun, who is actually Sterben, appears and proclaims that he is going to kill her.

						<episodePlot>After hearing that Kirito had killed people in SAO, Sinon asks him how he was able to overcome the memories of the people he killed, but Kirito reveals that he didn&apos;t overcome them, instead accepting the weight of them, since it was all he could do to atone for his actions. Then, while thinking about how Death Gun was able to stop the heart of players by shooting them in the game, Kirito realizes that Death Gun did not shoot him with the pistol, but with the sniper instead. Based on this, Kirito deduces that Death Gun had to make preparations in real life to be able to kill the players with his pistol, and that he could&apos;ve seen players putting their real-life details in the General Governor&apos;s Office since it was an open space and the terminals did not offer much privacy. Kirito then brings up the idea that Death Gun could have used his mantle to spy on other players without being noticed. After some thinking, Kirito realizes that Death Gun was actually two people: one shoots the player in-game, the other kills the player in real life by injecting them with a lethal drug. Meanwhile, Kikuoka Seijiro logs onto ALO as Chrysheight under Asuna&apos;s request and, after Yui reveals all the information on the incident that she had gathered, Chrysheight explains the situation to Asuna and the others.

						<episodePlot>After checking the map, Kirito finds that twenty-four players had already been killed, while only Yamikaze and himself are shown on the map. Seeing as, even accounting for Sinon, Death Gun, and Pale Rider, the numbers of those killed and those who are still alive did not match the total, he speculates that Death Gun had more than one accomplice in charge of the killings in the real world. Fearing that Yamikaze might also be a target, Kirito and Sinon decide to set up the former as bait, while Sinon snipes Yamikaze and Death Gun from a distance when they arrive. Sometime later, while Yamikaze is closing in on Kirito, Death Gun attempts to kill Kirito himself. Sensing his intent to kill, Kirito manages to sense where he would be shot from and barely manages to dodge the bullet. Noticing a sniper shot, Yamikaze immediately hides behind an obstacle for cover, but he is then shot by Sinon and killed. Sinon then turns her attention to Death Gun, but, as she had already fired her first shot, which wouldn&apos;t be detected, Death Gun is able to see her targeting him. The two of them fire at each other at the same time and, while Death Gun manages to destroy Sinon&apos;s scope, she manages to destroy Death Gun&apos;s weapon. However, as Kirito is about to strike Death Gun, the latter pulls out an estoc and counters the attack.

While they are fighting, Kirito has a flashback to the meeting before the Laughing Coffin raid in Sword Art Online, recalling a strikingly similar player with the same red eyes as Death Gun. Kirito deduces that Death Gun is really the infamous, &quot;Red Eyed,&quot; Xaxa, the second in command of Laughing Coffin. As Xaxa goes for the final blow, Sinon creates the illusion of a direction line using her experience in the game alone, causing Xaxa to cloak to avoid it. However, Kirito pulls out his sidearm and fires it at Xaxa, stopping the cloaking process and rendering him vulnerable. Using the willpower and strength he possessed in Sword Art Online, Kirito defeats Xaxa, cutting in clean in half. Before he dies, Xaxa reassures Kirito that their battle is not over. Sinon and Kirito then come to an agreement to end the Bullet of Bullets by committing double in-game suicide using a grenade, crowning them both the winner, but not before they reveal to each other their real names. After logging out, Shino is visited by Shinkawa, who, after making romantic advances on her, pulls out a syringe and reveals himself to be the second person involved in the Death Gun murders, which Kirito and Sinon earlier deduced while in the cave. Shinkawa tries to rape Shino, but she is able to get away, only to have Shinkawa pull her back. As this is happening, Kazuto bursts through Shino&apos;s door and attacks Shinkawa, holding him off while telling Shino, who recognizes Kazuto as Kirito, to run.</episodePlot>

As Shino was about to leave the school grounds, she saw that Kazuto was waiting for her near the entrance and drawing unwanted attention. Kazuto first drives Shino to a cafe to meet with Kikuoka Seijirou about the Death Gun incident. After that, Kazuto takes Shino to the Dicey Cafe, where he introduces her to Yuuki Asuna and Shinozaki Rika (Lisbeth). Kazuto then reveals that he had told the two girls about Shino&apos;s past and explains that he had them help him find a certain person that she should meet. The person is revealed to have been a woman, named Oosawa Sachie, who was the post office worker, threatened by the robber that Shino killed. The woman thanks Shino for saving her life and tells her that she was pregnant at the time, so Shino had also saved the life of her daughter, Mizue. Kazuto then explains that he wants Shino to think about the people that she had saved by killing the robber and thus be able to forgive herself for it.</episodePlot>

						<episodePlot>One day at the end of the year, Kirigaya Suguha showed her cousin, Kirigaya Kazuto, a news article about the legendary item, the «Holy Sword Excaliber», being discovered in ALfheim Online. Without delay, he called Asuna, Klein, Lisbeth, Silica and Sinon to challenge the dungeon in the sky of Jötunheimr, where Excaliber was . After preparing their items at Lisbeth&apos;s arms shop and purchasing potions for the adventure, the group entered Jötunheimr via a secret passageway in Alne. At the end of the tunnel, they reached the top of Jötunheimr and Leafa called Tonkii, a flying evil-god-class monster that they had befriended several months ago. The group climbed on Tonkii&apos;s back and asked it to ferry them to the ice dungeon. However, along the way, Tonkii suddenly dived and stopped at an altitude where they could see the ground. There they saw that players were cooperating with the humanoid evil-god-class monsters to massacre Tonkii&apos;s kin, the beast evil-god-class monsters. As they were watching the scene, a giant NPC, the «Queen of the Lake» Urðr, appeared behind them. The NPC explained that the massacre was ordered by the king of the giants, Þrym, who once threw the Holy Sword Excaliber into Urðr&apos;s Spring and caused the world of Jötunheimr to turn into an icy wasteland. She then explained that if all of Tonkii&apos;s kin were slaughtered, she would lose her power and this would allow Þrym to invade the land of the fairies, Alfheim. To prevent this, Urðr requested the fairies to retrieve the Holy Sword Excaliber from the bottom of the ice dungeon, called Þrymheimr.</episodePlot>

						<episodePlot>At the entrance to Thrymheim, Yui explains that the quest they were given was created by the Cardinal System&apos;s Automatic Quest Generation Function and that if they did not succeed in their quest, a final war event, Ragnarok, would be triggered. Sometime later, at the end of the second floor of Thrymheimr, the group encounters two minotaurs, and they are forced to rely on Sword Skills that could deal elemental damage to them in addition to physical damage, but also leave the player rigid for a few seconds after the skill is used up. With Kirito revealing his new technique of using consecutive Sword Skills with each of his swords to avoid the period of rigidity, they are able to defeat the two minotaurs. Later, after defeating the boss guarding the entrance to the lowest floor of the castle, they encounter an NPC woman trapped in an ice cage along the way. Although the others insist that it is a trap and plan to avoid her, Klein ignores their advice and frees the woman, who was revealed to be Freyja. Instead of running away, Freyja asks to join the group and Kirito reluctantly agrees to the request. After preparing for the final battle by recharging their buffs, the group enters the throne room, where they met the king of the frost giants, Thrym.</episodePlot>

						<episodePlot>Thrym engages the group in battle, and they are supported by Freyja, who overwhelms Thrym with her own attacks. Thrym retaliates by freezing most of the group with an ice breath, then sending them flying backward with a powerful stomp of his foot. Just as he is about to finish them off, the uninjured Sinon distracts Thrym while the other search for a large golden hammer purported by Freyja to belong to her family, which is essential in defeating him. Kirito finds the hammer and throws it to Freyja, who catches it and then suddenly transforms into Thor, the Norse god of thunder, to everyone&apos;s shock. Thor, enraged at Thrym for stealing his hammer, then joins the group in the fight against Thrym. Eventually, they manage to overwhelm him before Thor finishes him off. As a reward for aiding him in Thrym&apos;s defeat, Thor grants Klein with Mjölnir, much to his dissatisfaction. A secret staircase then opens up, which leads the group to the bottom of Þrymheimr, and Excaliber. Kirito manages to pull it out of the frozen puddle, but it causes Þrymheimr to fall apart. As the floor they are on plunges down a chasm, they are saved by Tonkii, and Kirito, knowing that Excaliber is too heavy for Tonkii to carry with everyone else throws it down the chasm, but Sinon retrieves it with a magic-assisted arrow. She gives Excaliber back to Kirito under the condition that he remember her every time he uses the sword. The group then observes as the chasm is flooded with water and the World Tree&apos;s roots extend to its surface, causing new trees to grow. Urðr and her sisters Verdandi and Skuld appear and thank them for saving Jötunheimr, and Urðr gifts Kirito with Excaliber. Sometime later, in the real world, Kazuto, Suguha, and Shino test out a device that converts real-time footage into pseudo-3D for Yui to interact in before having lunch with the rest of the group, celebrating the conclusion of the quest.</episodePlot>

						<episodePlot>Yuuki takes Asuna to an inn in Ronbaru and introduces her to the other members of the Sleeping Knights: Jun, Nori, Siune, Talken and Tecchi. Yuuki then reveals that the guild wanted Asuna&apos;s help in defeating the next Floor Boss with just one party. Siune explains that the group wanted to defeat the boss in order to etch their names on the Monument of Swordsmen, as they would not be able to adventure together after winter. After some thinking, Asuna agrees to help. Sometime later, while she is walking to the Teleport Gate plaza, Asuna is suddenly disconnected from the game by an unsatisfied Kyouko. After an unpleasant conversation with her mother, Asuna heads to a park in another residential area. There, she considers calling Kazuto, but decides that she did not want to expose her weakness to him. The next day, she meets up with the Sleeping Knights and they easily manage to reach the boss room, but Asuna detects several other players hiding near there. Though the players claim they are waiting for their friends, Asuna realizes they were actually spying on their battle to study the boss without sacrificing their own men. After the Sleeping Knights and Asuna are defeated and re-spawn in Ronbaru, Asuna tells the others what she discovered and they decide to rush to the boss room again before the guild had enough time to gather a raid group. At the boss room, they find a large amount of players gathered at the door. As the guild rejects the request of the Sleeping Knights to let them try again, Yuuki declares that they would fight it out and attacks the raid group&apos;s leader. At that point, the rest of the raid party arrives, but Kirito appears, having followed them, and blocks their path.</episodePlot>

						<episodePlot>After Kirito blocked the raiding guild&apos;s reinforcements, three mages of guild fired multiple magical projectiles at him. However, he used «Deadly Sins» to break all seven projectiles. As the reinforcements got into formation for battle, Kirito told Asuna that he would hold them off for three minutes with the help of Klein. In the meantime, the Sleeping Knights engaged the guild&apos;s forces blocking the path to the boss room. But, seeing that their assault was rendered useless by the intervention of the guild&apos;s healers, Asuna asked Siune to manage the healing herself and used «Flashing Penetrator» to break through to the healers, while killing the group&apos;s leader. After the healers were disposed of, the remained of the players were easily defeated, allowing Asuna and the others to enter the boss room. During the boss battle, Talken&apos;s spear was thrown into the air by the boss and it accidentally hit a crystal where the boss&apos;s two heads connected. Seeing that this caused the boss to assume a guard stance, Asuna deduced that it might be its weak point and tested it out by firing several ice pillars at the same spot. Confirming her deduction, Asuna left the healing to Siune to tell Yuuki to use a Sword Skill at the weak spot. Following Asuna&apos;s suggestion to use Tecchi as a stepping stone, Yuuki defeated the boss with her signature Original Sword Skill. After the battle, the group agreed to celebrate at Asuna&apos;s player home. While conversing about various things, Asuna asked whether she could join the Sleeping Knights, but, seeing that it resulted in an unpleasant reaction, she decided to change the topic and reminded everyone about the Monument of Swordsmen. At the monument, everyone took a picture and Yuuki accidentally called Asuna as her elder sister. Since she had also done the same in the boss room, Asuna pointed this out to Yuuki. Unexpectedly, Yuuki started crying and abruptly logged off.</episodePlot>

Yuuki takes part in the lectures and becomes popular with her classmates. Afterwards, Asuna takes Yuuki to the old Konno residence, which Yuuki reveals is about to be torn down soon, so she wished to see it for one last time. She then admits that by seeing her house she realized how her mother had been surrounding her with her feelings. Asuna tells Yuuki about her relationship with her own mother and asks Yuuki how to be as strong as her. However, Yuuki claims that she was not strong, but instead, she did not feel like she had time to waste, so she would always be honest with her feelings. She then recommends Asuna to talk with her mother and share what she felt. Using Yuuki&apos;s advice, Asuna asks Kyouko to log into ALO with her so she could show it to her. Kyouko reluctantly agrees and uses Asuna&apos;s sub account to log in. At the Forest House, Kyouko is reminded of her parents&apos; home. Asuna then tells her mother about how happy her parents were of her and how they wished to protect their home so Kyouko would have a place to return to. Asuna then says that she realized how life was not about just doing things for oneself and how the happiness of others could make one happy as well, thus she wanted to remain in her current school where she could support the ones she loved. The next morning, Kyouko tells Asuna that if she planned to support someone, she had to be strong herself, thus she would have to work hard on her grades to get into a university and whether Asuna would have to transfer would depend on her progress.</episodePlot>
